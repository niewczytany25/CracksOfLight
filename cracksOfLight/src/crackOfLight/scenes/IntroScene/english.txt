"Have you tried the oncoming approximation here?
So what if it's JavaFX!?"
Augustin Jean Fresnel


For decades, the legends of this university
speak of brave physicists,
beautiful women
and mystical creatures.

But we're not about that....




Imagine a hot, June evening.
You've just survived a tough math exam,
all you crave
is a moment of relaxation with friends.

Together with your photon brothers,
you decide to go to the wall
oh, what a beautiful place!
So full of noise, joy, and percent :)

However, one of your friends is uncertain.
Holding in her hands a package
shaped like a banana
(yes, there's a banana in it)
She advises against this idea.
There are legends circulating that the wall is a real
Bermuda Triangle of Warsaw -
People disappear there in
unexplained circumstances,
and all that remains of them

is the sweet-bitter smell of gingerbread cookies.....



Unmoved, along with your friends,
you decide to go to the wall
After all, what could go wrong?
The only danger is the city guard
Or 15-year-olds trying to bum a few cigarettes
After substantial shopping,
you reach your dream destination
Noise, flying percents,
and the quiet chirping of crickets -
in short, a perfect evening!
Suddenly, the consumed alcohol causes
a wild craving for food.
You ask your friends with fancy
packaging if she has anything good.

With a strange smile, she says,
she has a few gingerbread cookies.



Neurons asleep with alcohol
don't suspect a conspiracy.
You take a few gingerbread cookies
and quickly stuff them into your mouth.

Suddenly, the world starts spinning,
it spins faster than Leo Messi with a ball.
You stumble on the sidewalk, 
hit your head on the wall, and...

Where are you?
You see darkness in front of you.



In the air hangs
a heavy smell and humidity.
Suddenly, you hear a low, male voice.


You look in his direction and see
the silhouette of a sturdy man
illuminated by the light
coming through the ceiling cracks.
